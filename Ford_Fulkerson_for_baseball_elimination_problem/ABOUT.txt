I implemented solution to famous so-called baseball elimination problem:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_flow_problem#Baseball_elimination
Flow directed graph (flow network) is being used to represent the problem and the Fordâ€“Fulkerson (maxflow) algorithm to solve it.

The input data text files must fit a number of conventions.
The requirements for the input files for the program could be found here:
